The following code snippet shows you how to create a new email with different properties.

To specify multiple email addresses in an email message, follow these steps:
Create an instance of the MailMessage class.
Specify the From and multiple To, Cc and Bcc addresses using the MailMessage instance.
Create an instance of the SmtpClient class and send the email using the Send method.

The code sample below shows how multiple To, CC and BCC addresses can be specified.

The MailMessage class has the Save() method that can save Outlook MSG files to disk or stream. The code snippets below create an instance of the MailMessage class, set properties like from, to, subject and body. The Save() method takes the file name as an argument. In addition, the Outlook Messages can be created with a compressed RTF body using the MapiConversionOptions. To set up, create a new Windows application and add a reference to the Aspose.Email dll into the project.
Create a new instance of the MailMessage class and set the From, To, Subject and Body properties.
Call the MailMessage class FromMailMessage method which accepts object of the MailMessage type. The FromMailMessage() method converts the MailMessage into a MailMessage (MSG).
Call the MapiMessage.Save() method to save the MSG file.
Write the following code in the click event of the button control of the Windows application.

In the example above, we created a simple MSG file. Aspose.Email also supports saving message files with attachments. All you need to do is to add the attachments to the MailMessage instance. Add attachments by calling the Add() method on the MailMessage.Attachments collection. Add a listbox to the form created above and add two buttons, one each for adding and removing attachments. The application that adds applications works like this:
When the Add Attachment button is clicked, an Open File Dialog is displayed to help users browse and select the attachment.
When a file has been selected, the full path is added to a list.
When the MSG file is created, the attachment paths are grabbed from the list and added to the MailMessage.Attachments collection.
Write the following code in the Add Attachment button's click event.

When the Remove Attachment button is clicked, remove the selected items from the listbox. Write the following code in the Remove Attachment button's click event.
